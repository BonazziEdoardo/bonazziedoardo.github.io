I am a **Maths & Computer Science Ph.D. Student** at Bocconi University. This is a first attempt to build my personal website! 

[comment]: <I attended [**Military Navy College** "F. Morosini"](http://www.marina.difesa.it/EN/training_institute/morosini/Pagine/default.aspx), in Venice, I am a member of [LeadTheFuture](https://leadthefuture.tech), the leading mentoring program for STEM students in Italy, and I have been junior entrepreneur at [JEToP](https://jetop.com).>
